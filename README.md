This gem contains the [zoom.us](https://zoom.us/) strategy for OmniAuth.

## Before You Begin

You should have already installed OmniAuth into your app; if not, read the [OmniAuth README](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) to get started.

Now sign into the [zoom App Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/guides) and create an application. Take note of your API keys.

## Using This Strategy

First start by adding this gem to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-zoom'
```

If you need to use the latest HEAD version, you can do so with:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-zoom', :github => 'koshilife/omniauth-zoom'
```

Next, tell OmniAuth about this provider. For a Rails app, your `config/initializers/omniauth.rb` file should look like this:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :zoom, "API_KEY", "API_SECRET"
end
```

Replace `"API_KEY"` and `"API_SECRET"` with the appropriate values you obtained [earlier](https://marketplace.zoom.us/user/build).

## Auth Hash Example

The auth hash `request.env['omniauth.auth']` would look like this:

```js
TODO
```
